# Background

We are here because of our love for Star Trek and beer.  Who would have ever imagined we would get tired of the typical draft beer and decide to brew our on own beer.  It started out as a small group competition that resulted in us picking a few brews, purchasing a building to meet and finally a full blown brewery that attracks not just Star Wars fans but fans of science fiction in general.  The Borg has assimilated 10 different draft beers and 2 seasonal beers. 

# Objective 

Last month, the talk of selling our brew to other breweries caught fire.  We sat around brainstorming and really getting to know where.  Way too many ideas were thrown on the table and most were not based on any research.  In an attempt to further the discussion, we (James, Max and Nikhil) decided to do some research hoping to channel our discussion around factual data to best of our knowledge.  The data we have collected contains a sample of breweries by city/state and the desired taste by state, including correlations between ABV/IBU and between population and market size.  This will help to narrow our focus to areas where beer is seen as a necessity and a strong opinion as to the desired taste.  

# Breweries by State

First, lets take a look at the data we have.  Keep in mind, this isn't an exhaustive list of breweries but just a sample by state. If we had an exhaustive list of breweries just imagine the decisions we;ll be able to safely make.  

```{r}
beers = read.csv('data/Beers.csv')
breweries = read.csv('data/Breweries.csv') %>%
  mutate(State = trimws(State,'both')) #removing trailing spaces

str(beers)
str(breweries)

# Both dataframes have column called 'Name'.
# In beers, it refers to the name of the beer
# In breweries, it refers to the name of the breweries.
# Let's rename for clarity, especially after merging.

names(beers)[names(beers) %in% 'Name'] <- 'Beer'
names(breweries)[names(breweries) %in% 'Name'] <- 'Brewery'

str(beers)
str(breweries)
```

## How many breweries are present in each state?

Counting the number of breweries per each State

```{r}
breweriesState = breweries %>% count(State) # Option 2 . This is better! 
DT::datatable(breweriesState,rownames = F)
```


With a more extensive data set we can begin to answer the following questions:

Where can we focus our research?

- Top 10 States: CO, CA, MI, OR, TX, PA, MA, WA, IN, WI

Where should we avoid making strong assumptions?

- Bottom 10 States: DC, ND, SD, WV, AR, DE, MS, NV, AL, KS

## Map of States and Breweries 

A visual chart of number of breweries by State can help to identify geographical patterns.

```{r Leaflet_Map_Count}
#adding the count columns to the states spatial data
states = sp::merge(states,breweriesState,by.x='abb',by.y='State')

bins <- c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30,Inf)
pal <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = states$n, bins = bins)

labels <- sprintf("<strong>%s</strong><br/>%g Breweries",states$name, states$n) %>% lapply(htmltools::HTML)

leaflet(states) %>%
  setView(-96, 37.8, 4) %>%
  addProviderTiles("MapBox", options = providerTileOptions(
    id = "mapbox.light",
    accessToken = Sys.getenv('MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN'))) %>%
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~pal(n),
    weight = 2,
    opacity = 1,
    color = "white",
    dashArray = "3",
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    highlight = highlightOptions(
      weight = 5,
      color = "#666",
      dashArray = "",
      fillOpacity = 0.7,
      bringToFront = TRUE),
    label = labels,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
      textsize = "15px",
      direction = "auto")) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal, values = ~n, opacity = 0.7,
            position = "bottomright", title='Breweries per State')

```

A more visual representation shows the top 3 states:

- Colorado - 47 breweries
- California - 39 breweries
- Michigan - 32 breweries

If we're going to expand we should start our in depth research with these three states but first let's take a look at the types of beer that are popular in the these states.  

# Merge beer w/breweries

Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file

```{r}
data = merge(beers,breweries,by.x='Brewery_id',by.y='Brew_ID',all=T) 

h4('First 6 Observations')
DT::datatable(head(data,6),rownames = F)

h4('Last 6 Observations')
DT::datatable(tail(data,6),rownames = F)
```

# Data Cleanliness Check

Some of the data is incomplete.  A report of the number of NA's in each column should give us the severity.  

```{r}
countNA = sapply(data,function(x){sum(is.na(x))})
kable(countNA,col.names='Count of NA')
```

With any data that we obtain, we'll need to verify it's completeness and take the proper corrective action to ensure we are not making decisions based on an inaccurate data set. 

# Alcohol Content and Bitterness

Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare

```{r fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}

summary = data %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(ABVMedian = median(ABV,na.rm=T)
            ,IBUMedian = median(IBU,na.rm=T)
            ) %>%
  ungroup() 

summary(summary)

summary = data %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(ABVMedian = median(ABV,na.rm=T) 
            ,IBUMedian = median(IBU,na.rm=T)
            )  %>%
  ungroup()
  
summary(summary)

ggplot(data=filter(summary,!is.na(ABVMedian))
       ,aes(x=fct_reorder(State,ABVMedian,desc=T)
                        ,y=ABVMedian)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("Median Alcohol Content") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent)+
  coord_flip()

ggplot(data=filter(summary,!is.na(IBUMedian))
       ,aes(x=fct_reorder(State,IBUMedian,desc=T)
                        ,y=IBUMedian)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("Median International Bitterness Unit") +
  coord_flip()

```


# Max Alcohol Content and Bitterness

Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

```{r}
message("The State with the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer is:"
        ,arrange(data,desc(ABV))$State[1]
        )

message("The State with the most bitter (IBU) beer is:"
        ,arrange(data,desc(IBU))$State[1]
        )
```

## Map of States and their max ABV

A visual chart of Max ABV by State can help to identify geographical patterns.

Preparing the data

```{r preparing_data}
#calculating max abv and mav ibu
statesABV_IBU=data %>%
  group_by(abb=State) %>%
  summarise(MaxABV= max(ABV,na.rm=T)
            ,MaxIBU = max(IBU,na.rm=T))  %>%
  ungroup()
#adding to the states map data frame
states = sp::merge(states,statesABV_IBU,by='abb',all.x=T)
```

Plotting the Map

```{r Leaflet_Map_ABC}
bins <- c(0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.10,Inf)
pal <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = states$MaxABV, bins = bins)

labels <- sprintf("<strong>%s</strong><br/>%g Max ABV",states$name, states$MaxABV) %>% lapply(htmltools::HTML)

leaflet(states) %>%
  setView(-96, 37.8, 4) %>%
  addProviderTiles("MapBox", options = providerTileOptions(
    id = "mapbox.light",
    accessToken = Sys.getenv('MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN'))) %>%
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~pal(MaxABV),
    weight = 2,
    opacity = 1,
    color = "white",
    dashArray = "3",
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    highlight = highlightOptions(
      weight = 5,
      color = "#666",
      dashArray = "",
      fillOpacity = 0.7,
      bringToFront = TRUE),
    label = labels,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
      textsize = "15px",
      direction = "auto")) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal, values = ~MaxABV, opacity = 0.7,
            position = "bottomright", title='Max ABV per State')

```

States with highest ABV are Colorado, Kentucky, Indiana, New York; all with an ABV value at or above 0.100

With the exception of Colorado, these states are located on the East of the country

## Map of States and their max IBU

A visual chart of Max  IBU by State can help to identify geographical patterns.

```{r Leaflet_Map_IBU}
bins <- c(30,80,100,120,Inf)
pal <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = states$MaxIBU, bins = bins)

labels <- sprintf("<strong>%s</strong><br/>%g Max IBU",states$name, states$MaxIBU) %>% lapply(htmltools::HTML)

leaflet(states) %>%
  setView(-96, 37.8, 4) %>%
  addProviderTiles("MapBox", options = providerTileOptions(
    id = "mapbox.light",
    accessToken = Sys.getenv('MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN'))) %>%
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~pal(MaxIBU),
    weight = 2,
    opacity = 1,
    color = "white",
    dashArray = "3",
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    highlight = highlightOptions(
      weight = 5,
      color = "#666",
      dashArray = "",
      fillOpacity = 0.7,
      bringToFront = TRUE),
    label = labels,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
      textsize = "15px",
      direction = "auto")) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal, values = ~MaxIBU, opacity = 0.7,
            position = "bottomright", title='Max IBU per State')

```

States with Maximum IBU are: Oregon, Virginia, Massachusetts, Ohio, Minnesota, Vermont; all with an IBU value at or above 120.

With the exception of Oregon, these states are located on the East of the country

# Summarize ABV Variable

Summary statistics for the ABV variable:

```{r}
summary(data$ABV)
```

# ABV / Bitterness Relationship

Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.

```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data=data,aes(x=IBU,y=ABV))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent)

model=lm(data=data,formula=ABV~IBU)
model
```

We have a very slight positive correlation between ABV and IBU, with a coefficient of `r round(model$coefficients[[2]]*100,digits=4)` of increase % Alcohol per IBU point

# Correlation with Population

Can we set our strategy based on the population of each State? Is the Market driven by number of potential customers?

## Breweries and Population

Is there a correlation between Population and Number of Breweries in each State? Is so which State has opportunity to have more breweries based on its population?

```{r}
#merge Beer, Breweries and populations
dataPop = data %>%
  left_join(select(dfStates,abb,pop),by=c("State"="abb"))

PopBrewery = dataPop %>%
  group_by(State,pop) %>%
  summarise(count = n_distinct(Brewery_id)) %>%
  ungroup()  

ggplot(data=PopBrewery, aes(x=pop, y=count)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +
  geom_text(aes(label=State),check_overlap=T,size=2.5,hjust=-.5) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Population (Thousands)',labels=function(x){comma(x,scale=1/1000)}) +
  ylab("Count of Breweries")

model=lm(data=PopBrewery,formula=pop~count)
```

We have a positive correlation between Population and number of Breweries in each State, with a coefficient of `r comma(model$coefficients[[2]])` people per each new Brewery

States below the trend line have the highest opportunity for Market Expansion

## Beers and Population

Is there a correlation between Population and Number of Breweries in each State? Is so which State has opportunity to have more breweries based on its population?

```{r}

PopBeers = dataPop %>%
  group_by(State,pop) %>%
  summarise(count = n_distinct(Beer_ID)) %>%
  ungroup()  

ggplot(data=PopBeers, aes(x=pop, y=count)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +
  geom_text(aes(label=State),check_overlap=T,size=2.5,hjust=-.5) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Population (Thousands)',labels=function(x){comma(x,scale=1/1000)}) +
  ylab("Count of Beers")


model=lm(data=PopBeers,formula=pop~count)
```

We have a positive correlation between Population and number of Beers in each State, with a coefficient of `r comma(model$coefficients[[2]])` people per each new Beer

States below the trend line have the highest opportunity for Market Expansion

# Summary of Findings

- There is a strong competition in the East and West of the country with more than 20 breweries per State

- Colorado is also a strong market with many breweries and Beers

- With few exceptions, the eastern States of the country tend to have highest ABV and IBU, in the Max and Median points of the distribution.

- There is a correlation between ABV and IBU (coefficient: +0.0351)

- There is a strong correlation between Beers and Population, with a new Beer per each 75K people

- There is a strong correlation between Breweries and Population, with a new Brewery per each 420K people

# Opportunities

- We see opportunities for Expansion in states like Florida, New York, Ohio, and Georgia that are below the Correlation Line between Beer, Breweries, and Population. 

- Within above States, we would highlight New York and Ohio states having the strongest  ABV and IBU. This could be a good fit for our strategy
